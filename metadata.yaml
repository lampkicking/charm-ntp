description: |
  NTP, the Network Time Protocol, is used to keep computer clocks accurate
  by synchronizing them over the Internet or a local network, or by
  following an accurate hardware receiver that interprets GPS, DCF-77,
  NIST or similar time signals.
  .
  This charm can be deployed alongside principle charms to enable NTP
  management across deployed services.
