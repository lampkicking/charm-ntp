      A string that will be prepended to instance name to set the host name
      in nagios. So for instance the hostname would be something like:
          juju-myservice-0
      If you're running multiple environments with the same services in them
      this allows you to differentiate between them.

        A comma-separated list of nagios servicegroups.
        If left empty, the nagios_context will be used as the servicegroup
